Inspired by Nicholas Felton, I spent the last month documenting moments of my life. The goal was the quanitfy the month of June in the areas of interactions with people, activities, sleep, and web usage. Here I present a high level view of my month by the numbers. Essentially I've managed to count June. 

##Important Note
All activity was recorded in my Calendar, therefore the measurements below are only within the count of recorded events. Hence, sleep is not included in the People or Activities sections, and any time spent alone is because an event was recorded alone (ie. Stats studying)

##People
<div id="people-donut"> </div>
Of these people I selected 5 to plot minutes spent with on each day. [ See the annotated version here](/assets/annotated_people.png).
<div id="people-area"> </div>
I spend the most amount of time with Nick Lauer. I'm **most social on Wednesdays** and **loneliest on Saturdays**. Given an event was recorded (excluding sleep), **the probability that I'm alone is 48%**. 

##Activity
Because over 50 unique types of activities were recorded, I broke them into subsections and dove deeper into education.
<div class="span5" style="height: 300px" id="activity-donut"> </div>
<div class="span5" style="height: 300px;" id="education-donut"> </div> <br/>
<p style="clear:both"> The time spent on each course is a sum of assignments, studying, classes, and exams. </p>
I attended **38% of classes**, played **999 minutes of Halo**, drank **38 glasses of orange juice, 21 of chocolate milk**, and ate **over 30 chicken breasts**. It takes me **1.8 minutes to read a page** of Game of Thrones, and I saw **4 movies** in theatres. For Algorithms, Statistics, Combinatorics, Accounting, and Law I earned 0.039%, 0.046%, 0.031%, 0.13%, and 0.033% on each midterm **for each minute I studied**.   

##The Internet
It's interesting to see the number of minutes I spent on each website. Note that this excludes mobile browsing (iPad & iPhone).
<div id="time_per_site"> </div>
But what's even more surprising is how weak the relationship is between facebook usage and studying. Note that this only includes studying for midterms.
<div id="fb_studying"> </div>
I spent 394 minutes in **messages**, 210 minutes in the **double degree group**, 54 minutes **looking at my own profile**, 27 looking at Marc Zuckerburgs and over 120 minutes on photos. 

##Sleep
Plotting my bedtime against how long I slept yields a consisntent gap. I seem to sleep the same amount each night, regardless of when I should be waking up.
<div id="sleep_time"> </div>
I sleep best on **Sundays** and longest on **Saturdays**. I sleep worst on **Tuesdays** and spend the least amount of time in bed on **Wednesdays**. On average I sleep for **6.8 hours** and go to sleep at **2:44 am**.
