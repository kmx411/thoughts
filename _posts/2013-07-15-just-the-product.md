Inspired by Nicholas Felton, I spent the last month documenting moments of my life. The goal was the quanitfy the month of June in the areas of interactions with people, activities, sleep, and computer usage. Here I present a high level view of my month by the numbers. Essentially I've managed to count June. 

##Important Note
All activity was recorded in my Calendar, therefore the measurements below are only within the count of recorded events. Hence, sleep is not included in the People or Activities sections, and any time spent alone is because an event was recorded alone (ie. Stats studying)

##People
<div id="people-donut"> </div>
Of these people I selected 5 to compare the amount of minutes spent with them for each day of the month. See the annotated version [here](/assets/annotated_people.png).
<div id="people-area"> </div>
I spend the most amount of time with Nick Lauer. I'm **most social on Wednesdays** and **loneliest on Saturdays**. Given an event was recorded (excluding sleep), **the probability that I'm alone is 48%**. 

##Activity
Because over 50 unique types of activities were recorded, I broke them into subsections.
